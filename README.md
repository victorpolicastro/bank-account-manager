Bank Account Transactions simple manages your account
Input all data and find out why you don't have money by the end of the month :p

## About the project

Bank Account Transactions is a monolith application to keep up the studies by the weekend
Maybe studies go so well that it will not be a monolith someday

## How to run?

Use `rails s` and we are good to go

## Testing

Coverage of 100% is the goal always!
To run the tests, run `rspec` and to see it's coverage, `xdg-open coverage/index.html`

## Linter

To see all offense, run `rubocop`. Rubocop can correct some offenses by itself, so you can run `rubocop -A` to fix that offensive code
